# Initial TODO (WIP)

#Team Defined Repository and Software Coding Standards

- All code committed to the repository should be approved by all members of the team before being merged to master. This will be done via pull requests created when the work has been completed.
- When a basic CI/CD implementation has been created, branches should not merge when tests fail.
- Code should be written in a way which allows for Unit testing (if applicable) and Unit tests should be written for new features. These tests will then be executed via Github Actions.
- When committing to the repository a JIRA ticket reference should be included in the commit message.

#Repository Licencing
