## üë©‚Äçüíª Setting up

### 1. Setup the repository Git Hooks

Run the ./init.sh script in the root directory which will copy the git hooks into the required directories.

### 2. Check that Maven (installed in the repository) is working correctly.

Run the ./mvnw.sh script with the -v argument to ensure Maven is installed.

        ./mvnw -v

You should get something like the below output:

    Apache Maven 3.8.6 (84538c9988a25aec085021c365c560670ad80f63)
    Maven home: /Users/Jack/.m2/wrapper/dists/apache-maven-3.8.6-bin/67568434/apache-maven-3.8.6
    Java version: 16.0.2, vendor: Amazon.com Inc., runtime: /Users/Jack/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/corretto-16.0.2/Contents/Home
    Default locale: en_AU, platform encoding: UTF-8
    OS name: "mac os x", version: "12.2.1", arch: "x86_64", family: "mac"

Your chosen IDE will be able to import a Maven project and you can compile from with there. If you want to compile from the cmd line you can use the follow commands:

        ./mvnw compile

If you wish to package the code you can run the command:

        ./mvnw package

If you wish to run the tests in the repository:

        ./mvnw test

Information on Maven and its conventions can be found below.

### 3. How to run the application

To run the application you can go into the target/ directory and run the JAR file using Java.
An example command with the required arguments is:

        java -jar hawaiian-0.1.0.jar -p "/Users/Jack/processing-java" -t "/Users/Jack/Documents/Processing/Flocking"


You must have processing-java installed to install it open Processing then Tools and select 'Install process-java'.

## Repository Information

### Committing Your Code

- Any work done in the repository should be done in a branch off of master (or a branch with the needed changes).
Once work is completed on this branch a pull request should be created which then needs to get approved for the work to be merged into master.
- Branch naming convention is as follows (enforced via Git Hooks):
    - feat/<JIRA_REF>/Ticket-Title
    - Example: feat/PIZ-19/Test-Ticket
    - The prefix options are as follows:
        - feat
        - bug
        - improvement
        - release
        - hotfix
- Commit messages will automatically get the Jira ticket prepended to it via a Git Hook.
- 3 team members will need to approve the pull request for the work to be merged into master. This is enforced via Git rules.
- No committing to master directly (unless specifically required), this is enforced via a Git Hook
- Only specific changes done by the developers should be committed to the repository. IE any IDE added files should not be committed to the repository.

### Maven

    https://maven.apache.org/what-is-maven.html

Maven is a build management tool which will allow us to build our project consistently and standardised between OS. It will also handle package management and various other problems. Maven defines itself on its website as:

    Making the build process easy
    Providing a uniform build system
    Providing quality project information
    Encouraging better development practices

Maven also provides a nice testing framework that we can use to run our JUNIT tests. It provides the following testing features:

    Unit test reports including coverage
    Keeping test source code in a separate, but parallel source tree
    Using test case naming conventions to locate and execute tests
    Having test cases setup their environment instead of customizing the build for test preparation

Here is a good starter guide on Maven:

    https://spring.io/guides/gs/maven/#scratch

#### Maven Testing Conventions

Mavens convention for tests is that they should be located in the src/test/java/<package> directory. Any file with a name matching *Test in these directories will run with the following command:

    ./mvnw test

# Team Defined Repository and Software Coding Standards

- Code will be automatically formatted when work is pushed into the remote repository via Github Actions. The code is formatted in the Google Java Style: https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html

- When a push to the remote repository is done, JUNIT tests will run via Github Actions if the tests fail the branch will not be able to be merged into master.

- Code should be written in a way which allows for Unit testing (if applicable) and Unit tests should be written for new features. These tests will then be executed via Github Actions.
- Tests that are written should be in the directory src/test/* mimicing the src/main/* pathway of the file being tested. This will allow Maven to find and run your defined tests.

# Staging and Development Branches

- The staging and development branches are there so that work that has been completed on multiple branches can be merged into this branch and tested together. Any issues can then branch off this branch and be fixed before being merged back in.
- The development branch should be used first before
- The staging environment which is meant to be used as a testing environment before work goes to production.
- The latest master should be merged into these branches before other work is merged in.
