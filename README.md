# Initial TODO (WIP)

# Repository and Project Setup

- Jira, confluence documentation, README
- Team peer reviews:
   - Pull requests - approved by all members before code being merged to master on approval and Github Actions test pass.
- Repo rules defined in Github:
  - no committing to master directly, need to branch and have a ticket reference in commit message.
- Github actions:
  - basic tests - JUNIT? Other test tooling software.
- Linting rules:
  - software coding standard defined and enforced via linting software.
  - Static analysis
- Git hooks:
  - pre commit hooks
  - pre push commits
- Licencing:
  - Apache
- Dependency management:
  - Not needed at this stage?

# Chosen language:
 - Java

# Tests for repo:
 - Unit tests written by Devs and executed via Github Actions and locally.
 - End to end tests - Executed via Github Actions on commit.
 - Sanity tests? - Is this necessary.

# MVP - CLI Application
# Alpha / Beta: Application / Website?

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Program needs to:
 - Run Unit tests
 - Test objects creation and update it somehow
 - Test key presses call the correct object
 - Test events
 - Method isolation
 - Return types are correct
 - Static analysis correct.
 - No visual tests
 - Does not have to be from scratch
